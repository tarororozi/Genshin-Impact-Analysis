Blackmore674,22h,After playing though her story I have come to a conclusion... she's a Mary Sue. VIEW MORE REPLIES,Arlecchino
Anemo Yaksha,16h,That term has lost all meaning. A powerful female character is not automatically a Mary Sue. (Edited by Anemo Yaksha),Arlecchino
KuroFumi,16h,"Yeah, I have to agree with you on that. People just assume just because a character is powerful, they're a Gary Stu or a Mary Sue. Those are characters that have little to no depth and all of the depth is in their power. But this simply isn't the case for Arlecchino, nor any Genshin character so far. Even the badly written ones are far better in comparison to Gary Stus/Mary Sues. As they have at least a ton of lore in their character stories that never get shown on screen/in any events/quests.",Arlecchino
Ahrolkah,9h,"Arlecchino is not a Mary Sue just because she's powerful or interesting. She's a well written character, and powerful because she's the fourth-ranked Fatui Harbinger.  If she was super weak for no reason, or had no compelling backstory, then she would be the victim of bad writing.  I would say she merely fits in with her peers. Harbingers are always very strong and have backstories like hers. Childe fell into the abyss at a young age and came back with a dark power, Wanderer is a puppet created by a god that was cut loose for being too human, La Signora's lover dying and her literally burning up and turning into an elemental being, etc.  What did you expect? For her to be weak? Mild-mannered? Have a bland, one paragraph backstory? (Edited by Ahrolkah)",Arlecchino
Blackmore674,20m,"It's not just her being overly strong. Nobody hates her, everybody we meet either likes her or is neutral towards her. The only people who outright dislike her are portrayed as just being misinformed. The story even bends over backwards to present her as being a better person then what she actually is with presenting her predecessor as being even worse so that it can minimize the terrible things Arlecchino has done herself. Her method for dealing with traitors is proof of that. The Traveler even says that it's better than murder when all previous story regarding the act has all but outright said that it is no different than murder.",Arlecchino

BradD80,1d,"Overall she is amazing fun.  She is kind of a SOLOIST in that she wants a lot of field time and you do need to learn how to play her and use her BOND OF LIFE mechanics. The other Characters dabble in it, but she really embraces it as a core of what her character is play wise. And to keep her Pyro infusion going you really need to get the hang of the flow of her bond of life management.  You build the team to suit her.  You build the team to make her work better. Since she is going to be the MAJORITY of the field time.  Typically your going to use her skill, then rotate through her supports to activate all their stuff, then dump her onto the field to go ham with the Normal attack spam. Thats the simplist way to explain it, look up some guides for the real detail on this.  She is not a replacement for any of the existing DPS characters, they all play very differently. Hu tao for example gets tons of reactions while Daddy here likes to just do her own thing and brute force DPS things. Like I said she is the first real SOLOIST in terms of she is doing all the lifting on the eam while the other Pyro DPS will share time with Others on the team. I think the closets one to her is Yoimiya but even she likes to share some time with other people on the team while Daddy likes to be on the field as much as possible.  So far most teams are going to want a Shield character. Since she only heals off her burst when doing her thing. Or even Dehya to soak damage and prevents stagger.  She likes Yun Jin and Benny to boost her damage. In her case you might actually take Yun Jin over benny cause your not stuck in a circle and its easier to run around with Yun Jin, but Benny will provide more damage esp if hes C6.  She also likes overload comps with Chevy. Double Hydro and Hydro vape with Anemo shred work well. Mono Pyro is pretty good with her as well. Those type of comps are all good for her.  And she seems to work well with almost all weapons and they all seem to do good damage. Barring how you set up her support. White Tassel is Again a stand out budget weapon that can keep up with most of the other choices.       READ MORE",Arlecchino
BradD80,1d,"Oh yeah, her C1 is a good Quality of life con for her. And C2 adds a healthy boost to her damage and more res effects for her. Do you need them no. She is solid at C0 and you will likely use a shield character anyway so that can cover the stagger and res stuff you get from the first two cons.  But man C6.....if you have that your gonna just devastate things like a nuke. (Edited by BradD80)",Arlecchino
InspireRose?,1h,"This type of style even fits her lorewise, she's an independent single father LOL Thank you for the analysis, I'll keep this in mind if I do pull <3",Arlecchino
ZanathKariashi,1d,"Kind of bizarre that she has no utility passive at all. Could've at least gave her ""reveals fontaine regional goods"" like Lyney.

Dubbyonahill,4/18/2024,"@Ashgrun  ----- When Arlecchino uses a Charged Attack or her Elemental Burst, Balemoon Rising, she will absorb and clear nearby Blood—Debt Directives. Each Directive absorbed grants her a Bond of Life worth 65% Of her Max HP. The maximum value of the Bond of Life she can be granted through Directives within 35s after using her Elemental Skill is 145% of her Max HP. Using the Elemental Skill again during this duration will restart the count on duration and the limit on the value of Bond of Life she may gain from Blood-Debt Directives.

NDCuong1110,4/18/2024,"All of her skills consume a fixed BOL percentage, so I think her HP won't matter. Given that she can only be healed using her burst, you wouldn't even need a healer for her since the healing will not consume any amount of BOL at all.

Azzora Rose,11/29/2023,"They subtitled it as Otets when Lyney first mentioned her, which is Russian for Father.

Deleted account489238-5,11/22/2023,Yeah people really saying the fatui are actually the good guys because of one positive interaction we had with one which ironically falls right into her trap.,Arlecchino
Azzora Rose,12/3/2023,"It's easy to forget what the Fatui have done when they aren't a major threat in an archon quest for the first time ever. Think about it: Mondstadt the Fatui were pressuring the Knights to try to kill Dvalin, Liyue Childe set Osial free which nearly drowned the entire nation, the Fatui orchestrated the enitre Vision Hunt Decree in Inazuma, and Dottore tried to create a god to replace Nahida in Sumeru. So I think it's more so people find it refreshing that we have a Harbinger who helps solve a nation's crisis rather than repeat the same old plot of ""it was the Fatui all along!""  BUT. You are 100% right. Because anyone who is a part of the Fatui and dedicates their life to it is still in association with murderers and attempted murderers. The only reason we're currently ""allies"" with the Knave is because our interests were aligned. While she does seem to care a lot more about human life than most of her associates do, she's still manipulative and sometimes straight up cold to people who don't agree with her methods. It'll be interesting to see where our relationship can go in the future when we're no longer trying to save Fontaine from the prophecy",Arlecchino
Lucky Lugia,11/20/2023,"Really wondering what element her Delusion could be in the event that she has one. There's six reactions where Pyro is the first element. We can rule out Cryo because Signora already had that combination. Thus far, we haven't seen any Vision-Delusion combinations involving Dendro, Anemo, or Geo, so it probably won't be one of those (not that a Burning transformation wouldn't be cool). That leaves two, and considering that Fontaine is already the Hydro region, I'm inclined to suspect Electro. Overload Harbinger - pretty neat.",Arlecchino
Deleted account489238-5,11/22/2023,I actually think her delusion should be anemo because Then she'd have the elements of the magician twins and I'd think that'd be neat It's thematically appropriate because the house of hearth provides a false sense of freedom to its residents when it's arguably just another form of imprisonment We know anemo and geo delusions exist from the operatives and skirmishers so they shouldn't be ruled out.,Arlecchino

It's also the same name that appears in the Travel Log and above an NPC's head when you're not stuck in dialogue, but not all NPCs can be found like that (e.g. Signora), hence why I instead describe it as ""name as a speaker"".  Scaramouche's name as a speaker used to be ""Scaramouche"" in the English localization. However, this was changed in 4.0 so that his name as a speaker is ""The Balladeer"" to match his name as a speaker in the original Chinese version, as the English localization used to use each Fatui Harbinger's two names rather interchangeably based on what felt more natural in the English language and only started tightening up their usage to match the Chinese version much later on.  All NPCs who ""physically"" appear* in the game have their NPC name/name as a speaker as their page name on this wiki. NPCs who don't physically appear instead have their most-used name (if they're named at all) as their page name. This is the source of the conflicting names for the Fatui Harbingers in multiple different ways: Signora's name as a speaker is Signora, not The Fair Lady. It's not even La Signora Tartaglia's name as a speaker does not match his name as a playable character (a character's name as a playable character is prioritized over their name as an NPC) Scaramouche's name as a speaker used to be Scaramouche but is now The Balladeer Arlecchino's name as a speaker is The Knave If Arlecchino becomes a playable character, then based on Tartaglia, she's very likely to be named Arlecchino as a playable character The previous Knave is only hard confirmed to have previously been the Knave. It's unclear whether she was also an Arlecchino--and there's a high chance that she wasn't (see her page for more info) If there is one more Harbinger we haven't been introduced to yet... it's completely possible that they will be introduced with only one name (imagine if they were only mentioned in passing in some random NPC's dialogue). We'll have no choice but to make their page under whichever name was given to us. In fact, if we're given more than enough information to make a page for them but no name, then we'll have no choice but to use a really, really awkward page name, like ""Tenth of the Fatui Harbingers"" or something. (If we're not given that much information, then we'll try to hold off on making a page for as long as possible, because eeuugghh.)  READ MORE (Edited by SolarMist)",Arlecchino

SolarMist,9/29/2023,"?? I didn't and wasn't even going to pull out the Lore Master card...  My wall of text is the explanation of the contradictions using in-game dialogue, aka lore that does not intersect with gameplay, as my evidence. When considering lore that does intersect with gameplay, such as the order of VOs in the VO menu, then that softens the blow but does not address the contradictions present in dialogue.  In addition, lore that intersects with gameplay can be unreliable on its own and thus should always be supplementary rather than used on its own. As an example of what I mean by ""unreliable on its own"" using a different topic: Qiqi has a voice-over titled ""About Dusky Ming"" who we have no reason to believe is an NPC that will ever become playable. This makes ""About X"" VOs on their own unreliable as sources of information about the names of future playable characters. Thus, ""About X"" VOs must be used in conjunction with other evidence, such as unique character models.  But there's nothing that the VO order for Childe and Wanderer could be used in conjunction with. (Edited by SolarMist)",Arlecchino
AllAlongInGlass,9/30/2023,Yeah no.  The sheer fact both of them have the same exact order for all the Harbingers should've been enough.  It was consistent enough to be obvious that it spelt out the rankings plain as day alongside Pierro being referred to as the Director.,Arlecchino

AllAlongInGlass,10/1/2023,"The Efim argument is old news by now.  And I do not think this needs much elaborating on.  Prestige == rank. It refers to reputation.  Regardless of the Knave he was referring to, ""improve the Knave's reputation"" to a bunch of people who were already entrenched in the Hearth's teachings isn't a far-fetched front to keep up.  As for Capitano.  The Fatui themselves referring to one of their own, from the perspective of what are essentially a bunch of nationalists, as 'honourable' As A Specifically Snezhnayan Solider And Higher-up, contradicts absolutely nothing when you simply acknowledge the biases they would hold to begin with. To THEM, he is exemplary. Varka himself never explicitly stated he finds Capitano an honourable person. So. Again. It's only been other Fatui claiming Capitano is an honourable figure.  He's one of the Harbingers.  Any consideration for how ""honourable"" they are should be taken for a grain of salt.  Whether ""First Lord Harbinger"" on Clean House is frankly just at the mercy of the localisation's decisions.  It wouldn't be the first time vague/ambiguous wording had to be corrected as the game progresses.

Kai 12,7/5/2023,"@Damusagi No problem. I didn't think you were offensive. I just thought there's no need to put so much effort to dissect what is essentially a silly theory of mine.  Unlike what we know, the fatui believe that the 6th seat has been empty for hundreds of years (because of Wanderer messing with Irminsul). The 8th seat has also been empty ever since Signora's death. This goes to show that Harbingers don't just easily fill the 11 seats up whenever they are empty (due to someone dying or leaving their group), nor do they move everyone up a rank when that happens. This makes the 10th seat being empty not absolutely unreasonable.  The director of the Harbingers could still count as a Harbinger, I guess. Once again, I admit my theory has weaknesses.  @Hfwei Notice how Scaramouche/Wanderer has a tendency to be noticeably more dismissive and disrespecting of people beneath his rank in his voice lines. For the people above him, he at least doesn't call them weak, garbage, just a mortal. He's just a little shit like that, haha.  Honestly, harbinger ranking may not even be based entirely on combat power for all we know. Childe is known to be a well-known fighter even among the Harbingers, for example.",Arlecchino
Hfwei,7/5/2023,"Hmm childe did say its based on strength, and i agree. Childe is weak",Arlecchino
AllAlongInGlass,7/6/2023,"this is an weird debate to have when both wanderer and childe's voicelines about the harbingers are clearly in order of ranking (Dottore is the 2nd, Columbina the 3rd, Arlecchino after Columbina, and we know Pulcinella if the fifth, etc).  The voicelines skipping scaramouche bc the sixth harbinger 'no longer exists' and signora beneath all of them because she's Dead, with Pierro at the top as the Director of them all.  I know for its purposes as a wiki the editors can't add it in based on an educated guess but.  It's pretty obvious nonetheless.  Not to mention it's unlikely someone as lowly ranked as '10th' would be in charge of brainwashing all their war orphaned child soldiers.",Arlecchino

Turtle2387,4/9/2023,"The trope where there exists a leader with a special ranking or ranking higher than No. 1 of a group with number-based ranking system isn't uncommon in fiction, see Bleach's Espada or Hunter x Hunter's Phantom Troupe. There's nothing preventing Pierro from being part of the 11 Harbingers AND have a special and/or higher than No. 1 ranking.  Regarding Scaramouche's status after the event in Inazuma, we don't know what his deals with Dottore was and whether other Harbingers and Tsaritsa were aware of Scaramouche's involvement in Dottore's project or not. As far as Childe was concerned, all contact with Scaramouche was lost and thus his absence was deemed as suspicious. Even if Scaramouche didn't technically leave the Fatui, his status was still a unique one (AWOL - Absence without leave) and as he no longer functioned as a conventional member of the Harbingers due to having cut off contact with his peers, Childe's voiceline about him being placed at an unusual place isn't anything of concerned to the overall order. About your concern of future change among the Harbingers and whether or not the voicelines will reflect that, it is for the future to show, though the next time a major change happens, or we get the next batch of Harbingers voicelines, I doubt our discussion here matter anymore.",Arlecchino
YozH Of Future,4/10/2023,"Bleach's Espada was positioned as a grouping, otherwise called ""ten blades"", but with a different score - from 0 to 9. It is a completely different situation when the composition of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers ends with the number 11. In the case of Fatui, there are immediately 11 members, if Pierro were called "" zero"", then the grouping would be called the Twelve. In the case of the Phantom Troupe, there are no set rules for numbering. There are places, but they can rotate as you like, no number is provided in advance. The state of Scaramouche in Childe's remarks is delusional to justify. Anything could happen to him on behalf of Fatui, and such a ""unique"" status is not able to move the Harbinger somewhere lower, separating him from the rest of the group.",Arlecchino

Johnnyfire 117 or 17,7/27/2022,It might be due to her face being similar with also having similar hair (without the ponytail and different hair bang).,Arlecchino
VvalkyrieV,7/1/2023,Johnnyfire yeaaah some time has passed but i dont think Eulas and Arlecchinos faces are similiar I think its just her hair that looks bluelike thanks to the bad light in her main appearance that made everyone talk about how similiar they are,Arlecchino

ScarlettOWO,7/13/2022,That is what i was thinking! Sheznian Eula,Arlecchino
Anti-brouillard,7/12/2022,"I am fairly disappointed by her. Arlecchino is supposed to wear a mask, a hat, and a colourful checkered outfit, so where are they? Only her eyes seem to match the original Arlecchino Sure that is probably a Snezhnayan outfit only worn for special occasions, but her hair being black and white it screams duotone and it is definitely not a good sign. She looks more like Cruella de Vil than the actual Arlecchino.  Arlecchino is one of the most famous characters from the commedia dell'arte and they didn't even respect his original attributes (Edited by Anti-brouillard)",Arlecchino
Simuod,7/12/2022,"It says in the main Harbinger name that their titles are DERIVED from the stock characters in commedia dell'arte, not THEY ARE the stock characters, so the only part from commedia dell'arte is the names.",Arlecchino

Cjsintern,7/11/2022,"They wouldnt do that because the names and their personalities are straight references from Comedia dell'arte. If you think about it, Pulcinella also sounds a bit like a female name but in reality, Pulcinella is a short elf with a mustache",Arlecchino
2Twice,7/11/2022,"Well, not exactly. It was pointed out that one of the harbinger’s (I forget which) was very different personality-wise to their comedia counterpart. Hoyo is obviously gonna make changes to that, which was made quite obvious as soon as they made Arlecchino a female",Arlecchino
CookiePoi,7/16/2022,"They are codenames, so it wouldnt need to change to fit the gender. like La Signora's and Tartaglias real name are Rosaline and Ajax",Arlecchino
2Twice,7/29/2022,"Yeah but the code names are based on characters, so you’d expect them to line up with the character’s gender and personality. But it doesn’t (in Arlecchino’s case) Also there’s no way there would be a man called La Signora lmao",Arlecchino

Yanderebunny303,7/11/2022,"I think it's perfectly reasonable for the Harbingers to have more males. The Tsaritsa, the supreme power, is female, and Genshin already has a crazy gender ratio of double the females to males.",Arlecchino
Dumbaxe,2/7/2022,"Is it just me, or does the concept of the orphanage + raising orphaned children as spies thing remind me of the Red Room from Black Widow?",Arlecchino
EliSan111,2/2/2022,"I am not sure if anyone mentioned it before about Arlecchino or not, so I'll just say it. There is a pretty high chance that Arlecchino's Harbinger alias is ""The Reaper"". Let me explain why. In Russia people have 3 parts to their name 1) first name 2) family name 3) second name (which is formed by adding a suffix to the one's fathers name) People from the orphanage (Arlecchino runs an orphanage) all have Schneitzevna or Schneitzevich as their family names which is exactly how Russias second names are formed. Schneitz-evna and Schneitz-evich. This shows that whoever this Schneitz is he is like a father to the people of the orphanage and that makes me think about Arlecchino. And what does Schneitz mean? It is a latin spelling of the Russian word ""Жнец"", The Reaper. Thus ""The Reaper"" might be his Harbinger moniker. And since Reapers trademark weapon is a scythe, he might turn out to be a scythe user. The indirect confirmation to this hypothesis might be the top left Harbinger emblem that kind of looks like a top part of a scythe to me. I expect that one to be Arlecchinos emblem (Edited by EliSan111)",Arlecchino
